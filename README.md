# The New Language - Sut-han
### Inspiration
Sut-hanaf is primarily based upon obscure naturalistic languages, from Cherokee to Estonian to the many Bantu languages. This odd mixture of different cultures negates any sort of culture that would be inherent to each, thus rendering the language entirely without culture and somewhat alien. However, it - takes inspiration from a great number of constructed languages, largely philosophical in nature. It is primarily analytic; however, it has a number of aggluntinative features.

### The Content of Sut-han
###### Overview
Sut-hanaf divides its words into three different categories - noun, descriptor, and interjection. Descriptors are themselves divided into active (verbs) and inactive (adjectives) (note: both are together primarily because they act similarly gramatically). Word order is strictly SOV.

###### Morphemes

aspect:

* Imperfect: mas
* Perfect: suk

mood:

* Indicative: san

(relational suffixes - used to denote the relation between a subject and an object, and in some cases a descriptor)
* bound by: - bu (subject, object, descriptor)
* similar: - ha (subject, object)
* free of - pu (subject, object, descriptor)
* same - si (subject, object)

* in the spirit of community - is (subject, object, descriptor
* familial - fin (subject, object)
* siblings - fil (subject, object)
* mother/father - bit (subject object)

When a relational suffix applies from the subject to the object (ie, the subject hates the object, the subject loves the object), the ending - tal is used
When a relational suffix applies from the object to the subject (the object hates the subject, etc, etc), the ending -tun is used.
When a relational suffixes applies from either the object or subject to the verb (the object/subject hates doing the verb), the ending -hak is used.

(posession)

* composition: mot
* ownership: mo



###### Nouns
Sut-hanaf's nouns are characterized by noun-classes. While in most naturalistic languages using such classes, indivdual morphemes are essentially "assigned" to a class similarly to gender, in Sut-hanaf, the speaker must assign the morpheme. The noun classes follow:

- Animacy - al
- Liquid - jul
- Solid - kal
 - Edibility: pin
 - Fresh: jat
 - Short - jij
 - Long - jal
 - Large - hun
 - Small - hin
 - Hard - tak
 - Soft - sam
 - high - ut
 - low - mut
  - flat - pa
 - rough - jak
 - smooth - hi
 - Existing - kat
- Imaginary - im
- Natural - nuj
- Manmade, relating to man - nat
- Good - pi
- Bad - ni
- head - hul
- mouth/tongue - sut
- limbs - tut
- torso - yut
- heart - bul
- chest - kun

Class numbers 1 - 22 are strictly defined; this means that they must be used in a literal sense. In essence, to place a morpheme in a class, one must ensure that the intended connotation involves the class. One may place a noun into multiple classes if one wishes; however, this is discouraged. Classes between 1 and 22, inclusive, cannot be combined with 23 - 28, and vice versa. Class numbers 23 - 28 are not so strictly defined; they instead impart meaning dependent on the form and function of the body-part used. These are listed below:

* Head: round, relating to thought
* Mouth/tongue: a hole; relating to speech and to the action of eating
* Limbs: something long and thin; relating to propulsion, strength
* torso: rectangular or oval-shaped; related to digestion and the creation of life
* Heart: no shape connotation; related to pulsing movements, drum-like sounds, and emotion
* Chest: no shape connotation; related to breath

All nouns automatically refer to objects. In order to refer to an action or an attribute, one must use the following suffixes:

action - uf
attribute - if

###### Grammar

The grammar of Sut-han is simple. All sentence begin with tense/aspect/mood markers, in that order; if a clause within a sentence is of a different tense, aspect, or mood than the first clause of the said sentence, then the clause must also begin with the markers. 

These markers, with the suffix -it, may also be used to describe actions. For example, if an individual orders another individual to do something, then the imperative marker must be used, with the suffix it, before the subject, object, or the action being undertaken.

As was stated earlier, the language has SOV - or better put, SOD, in the case of this language - order.

If an inactive descriptor links a clause with the object, the clause is treated as the subject, and is thus put first. For example:

Existing on the lake, the house was next to the frog

would become, remaining in "English:"

House frog next lake existing;

better illustrated as

(((House frog) next) lake) existing.
